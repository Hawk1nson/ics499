Gary, Andrew:

I believe we have enough information and process details to make progress.

I think we need to manage this data in our database (since the focus in on women's health, we will go with the forms they provided).  
Security, Access, Reports, Trends, etc. will be based on this data.  We are building the framework. So, we can use some fake data to build, show and demo our work.

We can discuss this in the evening.

Thank you
Jasthi

- patient data
we will have a patient registration system/module.
Let us go with the custom unique key. (India has something called "Aadhaar card" just like Social Security Number; But many patients may not have it, may not remember it; So, we will create a unique ID as follows.
YYYYMMDDNNN

If I am the 5th patient seen on 4th Feb 2026, that patient gets the Unique ID as
20260204005


- case sheet data 
(one patient will have multiple case sheets; For example, when I go to annual physical exam every year, the doctor opens a case sheet) So, it is 1 to N relationship between patient and case sheet.

The id for the case_sheet can be a reference to the patient id
20260204005_01
20260204005_02
and so on

Case Sheet data is the heart of the system. The forms and data entry should be easier, user friendly, intuitive and quick.
(Use Case 1 (Para Medics): Data entry should be responsive - should work on mobile, ipad, desktop - if paramedics are entering the data directly in the system)
(Use Case 2 (Nurses / Data Entry):  Based on the filled-in form, operators wil be entering the data into the system
(Use Case 3: Something to explore: Can we rely on AI to scan the forms so that the data gets entered into the system).

- assets
educational resources (videos, audios, PDFs, brochures)
Default is Public and folks can mark some assets as Private
We do not manage these resources in our system.
We only manage the meta data of these resources
(at least, that is the current assumption/position)

- events
medical camps
educational seminars
should be managed.
So, we will have a event management system

- users
Of courses, we will have a users database (other than patients - we will keep patients in another table).
Users will have different roles.

- patient_feedback
it can be a grievance or complaint or positive feedback.
only registered / logged in patients can give the rating and feedback.
A summarized sentiment analysis will be provided to the doctors.
The feedback can be in Telugu or English or Voice.

- case_closure
Each case sheet on a patient leads to some closure
(a) On the spot disposition
(b) Medical advice (eg: prescriptions or medicines) and follow-up
(c) referral to a specialist or hospital
(d) pending (unknown)

Every case_sheet must have a case_closure

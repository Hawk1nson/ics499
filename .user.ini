; ─── PHP settings for BlueHost (PHP-FPM / FastCGI) ───────────────
; These replace php_flag/php_value directives that only work with mod_php.
; .user.ini is read by PHP-FPM automatically (cached for 5 min by default).

; Hide PHP version from response headers
expose_php = Off

; Disable file uploads until the feature is needed
file_uploads = Off

; Limit upload size defensively (when uploads are enabled)
upload_max_filesize = 2M

; Prevent remote file inclusion attacks
allow_url_include = Off
allow_url_fopen = Off

; Error handling: log errors, never display them
display_errors = Off
display_startup_errors = Off
log_errors = On
error_reporting = E_ALL

; Session security
session.cookie_httponly = On
session.cookie_samesite = Strict
session.use_strict_mode = On
session.use_only_cookies = On

; session.cookie_secure is set programmatically (auto-detects HTTPS)
; so it works on both local HTTP dev and BlueHost HTTPS production.
